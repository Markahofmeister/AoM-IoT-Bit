# AOM IoT Bit - Spring 2022
------------------------------------

## Summary
------------------------------------
The AOM IoT Bit, is a device that allows students to prototype with IoT, without the overhead of all the logistics that come with setup.

The goal is that students will be able to **easily link an AOM IoT Bit to a LittleBits circuit, and get that circuit to send and/or recieve data through a cloud-based system**.

------------------------------------
## Usage of a fully setup AOM IoT Bit
------------------------------------
To Use the AOM IoT Bit, all a student needs to do is the following:

- Open up a serial connection and ... add their credentials to the arduino_secrets_mine.h file ***[DO NOT SHARE THIS!]***

- Push the code to the MKR 1010 Arduino Board.

- Plug it in to their LittleBits circuit, and set the onboard switch to the proper setting (Push, Poll, Both)
